# IBM-Data-Science-Certification-Projects-202
Contains all assignements I have done in the scope of my IBM data science certification on coursera.
At this day, there are two folders corresponding to two different assignments each regarding one aspect of data science journey.
## 1. DataScienceEcosystem
Here I test my familiarity with Data Science Ecosystem : Methodologies and tools.
## 2. Python-Project-for-Data-Science 
This project was about web scrapping and data extraction. For instance, I worked with the yFinance library for analyzing
historical stock data of companies such as Tesla.

**Thank you !**
